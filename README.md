# Problem Definition

Airbnb is one of the world’s largest marketplaces for authentic accommodations that offer guests a place to stay, as well as local experiences. The site’s platform connects the hosts (those who are renting their homes), with the guests (persons looking for accommodation in that specific area). 
They have built a revenue model consisting of two sources of commission per booking. Airbnb charges the host 3% per successful transaction and charges guests 6-12% of their booking fee. Hence, one of Airbnb’s Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) is the number of bookings taking place. The higher the total number of bookings on the site, the higher the profits.

One way of achieving this would be through price optimization modelling against local competitors. Competition based pricing is a pricing method that involves setting your prices relative to the prices of similar competitors offering similar value. This would provide a competitive market price recommendation to newly added Airbnb listing given its attributes, providing them with the opportunity to set their prices at a more competitive rate. This leads to increased number of bookings by giving customers a price incentive. Thus, this would make such Airbnb listings more attractive to customers, and in turn lead to an increase in revenue for both the hosts and Airbnb.

Airbnb provides guides to hosts in an attempt to make useful recommendation that will increase the number of customers booking their listings.  Therefore, through classification modelling, popular and unpopular listings can be recognised allowing for the identification of significant factors that makes certain listings have a high number of bookings. This will help Airbnb to create more specific and effective recommendations in their guides for hosts (“Reducing your security deposit by $17 will increase your number of bookings”). Furthermore, this would also help to generate effective, most profitable listing recommendations to potential guests (“here are the top 20 recommended apartments in West Seattle for your price range and dates”). Ultimately, the goal is increasing bookings and thus profitability. 

Airbnb want to grow their network of profitable listing types. Classifying listings by popularity will help to identify listings are profitable providing Airbnb with an idea of what kinds of listings they should target to try bringing onto the site. 

Another way of achieving this is to target those with multiple homes, such as property developers. Therefore, cluster modelling will be used to find out what type of hosts exist in Seattle, therefore helping to develop diversified marketing allocated depending on host needs. For example, identifying more underperforming beginner hosts will allow Airbnb to provide targeted advice on how to improve in their handouts and training leaflets (“Provide discounts to customers who stay for longer!”). 

Further questions we want to answer:
-	How are listings distributed in Seattle?
-	What are the most expensive neighbourhoods?
-	What types of Airbnb listings exist in Seattle?
